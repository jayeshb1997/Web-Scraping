# Web-Scraping
In this project we converted  xml article to text document . Worked with NLP packages , ElementTree API ,BeautifulSoup to extract the data from xml file. Used lemmatization , stemming and stopwords for text cleansing.  Then i worked with NER(Name Entity Recognition) to
recognize name entities . After that found out token score and frequency of words as per client demand.
